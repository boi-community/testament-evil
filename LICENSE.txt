Hi. Thanks for your interest in Testament Evil and for reading this note. I quit development of this project and Isaac modding in general because I simply don't see it as worth doing any longer based on my personal goals with game development. There are many design ideas in Testament Evil which I want to use in an independent project eventually in the future, so I have been hesitant to release an unfinished project using them to some extent, but interest and enthusiasm for the mod have lasted a surprisingly long time, so I am releasing the last playable version from development and offering it to be played by anyone and potentially taken over by other developers.

As I am finished with it, my intention is to let people do whatever they want with the mod within reason, but "reason" is not universal, so I've written this note to be as explicit as possible.

This mod, Testament Evil, was originally designed and programmed by melon goodposter, sprited by lung, and made available in an unfinished, alpha state.

TESTAMENT EVIL PERMISSIONS:

1. Playing the mod:
	a. Yes, as much as you want.

2. Streaming/publishing video of the mod:
	a. Yes, but please mention that it is an alpha build in the stream/video or description.

3. Further developing the mod:
	a. Yes, anyone can do whatever they want in terms of developing the mod as an isaac mod with or without following my original intentions for the mod.
	b. If the mod is further developed or altered, please leave explicit information for players (a text file or description is fine) where the original version is and that your version is not the original version. This is to ensure people know who to credit/blame for any part of the mod.
	
4. Uploading the mod itself:
	a. Ask for permission. I want to be generally permissible with reuploads, especially of alternate versions, but I don't want the Steam Workshop being flooded with many unnecessary copies of the mod, and if someone decides to further develop the mod, I don't want version confusion to make that more difficult for them.
	
5. Crediting the mod:
	a. If you share or upload the mod anywhere, please note that the mod was originally designed and coded by melon goodposter, sprited by lung, made availble in its alpha state, and that any further additions or alterations (if any) are your own. Please include this text file with any version of the mod.

6. Charging for the mod or otherwise using its assets or design for profit:
	a. No. I am releasing this project and the design therein for free, so I don't want anyone to think they need to pay for it, but you can still contact me and ask about it if you believe you should have a worthy exception to this rule.

7. Contacting me, melon goodposter:
	a. Please contact me via Discord or Twitter if necessary.
	b. I probably can't tell you how every system in the mod works or other small details like that, because I don't remember.
	c. I probably CAN tell you about the reasoning behind design decisions and what future plans entailed if you want to make use if this info by doing any work on the mod.
	d. I probably CAN perform game design at weddings, birthday parties, etc for a modest fee.
