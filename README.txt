The following are some things you should know if you want to play the old unfinished build of Testament Evil released by melon goodposter on Modding of Isaac in February 2021. I recommend referring to this now and then while you learn how the mod works, instead of trying to memorize it all at once. Have fun!

Controls:
1. Use the mouse and keyboard. Keyboard-only and gamepad are sort of supported but not very well in this build.
2. Press the number keys to swap guns. Tap E to swap to your previous gun. You can also hold E and click to swap to a gun. You can also hold E and then press two number keys to change which numbers are bound to which guns.
3. Press C to open or close the Testament Evil menu. This was the first version of what is now the Dead Sea Scrolls which you may have seen in other mods, so it may conflict with them in this version.
4. Press Shift to activate the weapon skill when charged or double right click and hold to activate the knife skill when charged.
5. When holding a grenade at the ready, left click to throw the grenade or right click to lob it.

Mechanics:
1. Crits
	a. Some guns, like Leon's handgun, can be charged by holding the fire button. Releasing at the right time shoots a crit which does more damage and briefly stuns the enemy. Knifing a stunned enemy does critical knife damage. This combo is a great way to kill quickly and save ammo.
2. Weapon Skill and Knife Skill
	a. At the top of the screen are two fillable bars. The left bar is your weapon skill bar. It is unique to each weapon in your inventory and fills by shooting things. When it fills, press shift to activate its skill. Different weapons have different skills. The right bar is the knife skill bar and it fills by knifing things. To activate the knife skill, double right click and hold, then release when charged.
3. Items / The Merchant
	a. Some items are considered passive items and work the same as they always have. Others are now weapon mods which your character will stash in their attache case until you can attach them to a weapon later.
	b. You can buy from and sell to the merchant at the start of every floor after the first. You can also pay him to attach a weapon mod to a weapon. Attaching a mod not only lets you use that item with that weapon whenever it's out, but increases the clip size, and by extension the max ammo, of whatever weapon you attach it to.
	c. The timer at the top of the hud is your par time for the floor. If you finish the floor under the par time, the merchant will have special deals for you on the next floor.
4. Pickups and Pocket Items
	a. Herbs can be used to heal health or even gain more max hp. They can also be combined by holding an herb and walking over another. These are the valid combinations and their effects:
		GREEN = heals 1/2 a red heart
		GREEN + GREEN = heals 1 1/2 red hearts
		GREEN + GREEN + GREEN = heals all red hearts
		GREEN + RED = heals all red hearts
		GREEN + YELLOW = adds 1 heart container and heals 1/2 a red heart
		GREEN + RED + YELLOW = adds 1 heart container and heals all red hearts
	b. Pick up and use a box of ammo to gain ammo and refill clips of that type of ammo. Different types of weapons use different types of ammo, but ammo pools of a specific type are shared.
	c. Use a grenade to ready it. Left click to throw or right click to lob. Using a grenade with a grenade launcher in the inventory instead refills the launcher with grenades of that type.

Advice:
	1. Disable Isaac's extra HUD features. Testament Evil takes care of them.
	2. Testament Evil has its own difficulty settings in its menu. You don't have to play on Isaac's hard mode and I don't recommend it. Testament Evil's harder difficulties lower your range and ammo and limit your max HP, but spawn more money. You are intended to lose most runs.
	3. Manging ammo is a very important skill in Testament Evil. To save ammo, utilize crits and your knife. You want to have as much ammo as possible so that you can spend a lot of it to get out of bad situations quickly. Remember that each new gun you get, up to the four you can carry, can give you a new type of ammo at your disposal. If you see a box of ammo in a room, you know it will go to waste if you don't carry it out with you, so consider switching to a weapon that uses that type of ammo and going wild, then refilling the ammo, if you don't want to carry that box out.
	4. The weapon and knife skills are get-out-of-jail-free cards. Try to swap weapons so that you have as many full skills in your pocket as possible, and then use them when you run into a horrible room that is going to kill you or drain all your ammo.
	5. Play as Leon if you want balance. Other characters, especially modded characters, may work but are unlikely to be very balanced.
	6. Play Testament Evil with as few other mods as possible. It was developed without other mods and no compatibility work went into this version, so play with others at your own peril. Fiend Folio seems to work alright though.

Known Bugs:
	- The merchant may take your money without giving you anything in return if you buy a pocket item while already holding one. Consider dropping them as soon as you see the merchant.
	- The flamethrower's weapon skill is a placeholder. It's extremely OP and can cause the game to crash.
	- Lilith is one of the few characters that had custom weapons/mechanics implemented in this build, but she may spawn unlimited incubi in some circumstances.
	- The Merchant's blue fires may sometimes spawn as purple. Try dodging the shots if this happens.
	- The cursor may not realize you're in full screen and get confused. Try pressing F, moving the mouse around, or starting the game in windowed mode if this happens.
	- Many things may go wrong if you exit and continue.
	- You may encounter brand new bugs you can call your very own or rare mysterious crashes for no obvious reason.
